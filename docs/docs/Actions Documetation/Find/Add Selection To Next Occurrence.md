!!! note
    There is a setting under `Actionable > Find`, that specifies, finding occurrences should be case-sensitive or not.

    There is a toggle action to help you quickly change that setting!

    Find it under menu bar `Edit > Actionable > Global Toggles`.
    You may also assign a shortcut to it for convenience.
