Selects a literal element (usually refers to strings) under a caret.

!!! note
    This action is language aware, thus known languages are:

    * `java`
    * `kotlin`
    * `javascript`
    * `typescript`
    * `golang`

    In any file other than those above, the plugin tries to find the nearest quote pairs.

!!! tip
    By executing the action twice you can ==change between _selection with/without quotes_==.
