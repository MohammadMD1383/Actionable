## What Is _Actionable_?

**_Actionable_** is a plugin for all the IntelliJ-Based IDEs that adds
many extra actions, which makes it easier to interact with the IDE.

It provides you simpler ways to do repetitive tasks as well as doing
interesting things!

Enough here, letâ€™s see the plugin in action! [Getting Started](Getting%20Started.md)

## What's New In v4?

Along with all refactorings, cleanup and documentation changes, I decided to add language-specific actions
that help you do interesting things with your favorite language.

## Version 3 vs 4

Prior to v4 (up to v3.20.x), the plugin was used to provide a wide compatibility range.
But as of v4, the compatibility range would be less than it was in v3 and before.
This is because of providing better quality.
