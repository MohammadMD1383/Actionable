# IntelliJ Platform Actionable Plugin - [Documentation](https://mohammadmd1383.github.io/Actionable/)

This plugin adds some extra functionality that makes it easier to interact with the editor.

<b>Feel free to extend this plugin by your needs!</b>

## How does it work?

For convenience, I haven't added any hot keys to the actions by default.<br/>
If you like any of the actions you can add your favorite hotkeys to them.
